Q.    What are databases ? 
Ans : Databse is a collection of interreleted data.
      Which is basically a system of storing data in a structured way. 

Purpose of Databases :
    1. To store data in a structured way.
    2. To reduce redundency(data duplication).
    3. Databases can control the data inconsistency.
    4. Database facilitates the data manipulation, sharing etc.
    5. Database enforce standards and data security.
    6. Database can be used for data analysis.

Various Levels Of Implementation:
    1. Internal level(Physical Level).
    2. Conceptual level(Logical Level).
    3. External level(Network Level).


Person 1  ==> withdraw 100  Atm 1000       /// balance = 900
Person 2  ==> withdraw 200  Atm 1000       /// balance = 800


Concept of data independence:
    1. Physical Independence
    2. Logical Independence

Different types of datamodels:
    1. Relational Model
    2. Object Oriented Model
    3. Document Oriented Model
    4. XML Model
    5. JSON Model



Relational Database Terminologies:-
    1. Table:- Relation:- Relation is a set of tuples.
    2. Tuples:- Row:- Tuple is a set of attributes. 
    3. Column:- Attribute:- Attribute is a column of a table.
    4. Cardinality:- Cardinality is the number of tuples in a relation.
    5. Degree:- Degree is the number of attributes in a relation.
    6. Primary Key:- Primary Key is the attribute which uniquely identifies a tuple.
    7. Foreign Key:- Foreign Key is the attribute which uniquely identifies a tuple in another relation.
    8. Unique Key:- Unique Key is the attribute which uniquely identifies a tuple in a relation.
    10. Record :- Row of a table.




SQL: Structured Query Language
     SQL is a query language which is used to query data from a database.
     SQL is a simple language used for accessing, handeling ad managing data in a Relational Database.

Data Types :
    -- Integer --
    -- Float   --
    -- varchar --
    -- char    -- 
    -- date

Create Table Command : 
    create table <table_name> (
        <column_name> <data_type> <constraint> <default_value>,
        <column_name> <data_type> <constraint> <default_value>,
        ...
        ..
        .

    )


What are constraints Constraint ?
Restrictions on the data (Attribute).
    1. Not Null
    2. Unique
    3. Primary Key
    4. Foreign Key
    5. Check
    6. Default
    7. Serial
    8. References


Example Login Table ==> Username, password

Create table login(
    id serial primary key,
    username varchar not null unique,
    password varchar not null unique
);

Insert Command : 

insert into <table_name> (
    <column_name>,
    <column_name>,
    ...
    ...
    .
) values (
    <value>,
    <value>,
    ...
    ...
    .
);

insert into login values(1, 'admin', 'admin');
